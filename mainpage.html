        Fuzhou has grown considerably since the establishment of the People's
        Republic of China in 1949. Its water communications have been improved
        by the clearing of the Min River for navigation by medium-sized craft
        upstream to Nanping in central Fujian. In 1956 a railway linking Fuzhou
        with the interior of the province and with the main Chinese railway
        system was opened. The port too has been improved; Fuzhou itself is no
        longer accessible to seagoing ships, but Mawei (Luoxingta) port and
        another outer harbour, at Guantou on the coast of the East China Sea,
        have been modernized and improved. An express highway connects the city
        with Xiamen (Amoy), another major coastal city in Fujian. Fuzhou's
        international airport has regular flights to Hong Kong and other major
        cities in China.

        Two large power-generating facilities near Fuzhou—a thermal plant and
        the Shuikou hydroelectric station on the Min River—supply power to the
        city. The city is a centre for industrial chemicals and has
        food-processing, timber-working, engineering, electronics, papermaking,
        printing, and textile industries. In 1984 Fuzhou was designated one of
        China's “open” cities in the new open-door policy inviting foreign
        investments, and an economic and high-technology development zone in
        Mawei—together with other foreign investment districts—has been
        established.

        Handicrafts remain important, and the city is famous for its lacquer and
        wood products. Among Fuzhou's institutions of higher learning are Fujian
        Medical University (1937), Fuzhou University (1958), Fujian Normal
        University (1907), Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University (1936),
        and a research institute of the Chinese Academy of Science. Fuzhou is a
        city two millennia old, known for its history and culture, and in 1986
        the central government added it to the list of specially designated
        historical and cultural cities
