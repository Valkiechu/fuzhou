      <h2>History of Fuzhou</h2>
      <h3>Pre Qin History (before 221 BC)</h3>
      <p>
        The remains of 2 Neolithic Cultures - the Huqiutou Culture, from around
        5000 BC, and the Tanshian Culture, from around 3000 BC - have been
        discovered and excavated in the fuzhou area. During the Warring States
        period, chinese began referring to the mordern Fujian Area as Min Yue.
        Suggesting that native inhabitants of the area were in a branch of the
        Yue People, a Diverse Population of non-Chinese tribles who once
        inhabited most of the southern China.n 306 BC, the Yue Kingdom
        (present-day Zhejiang) fell to the state of Chu. Han Dynasty historian
        Sima Qian wrote that the surviving members of the Yue royal family fled
        south to what is now Fujian, where they settled alongside the native Yue
        people, joining Chinese and Yue culture to create Minyue. Their major
        centre was not at Fuzhou's modern location, but further up the Min
        watershed near Wuyishan City.

      <h3>Qin and Han Dynasties(221 BC- AD 206)</h3>
      <p>
        The First Emperor of Qin unified ancient China in 221 BC and desired to
        bring the southern and southeast regions under Chinese rule. The Qin
        dynasty organized its territory into "Commanderies" —roughly equivalent
        to a province or prefecture—and the Fujian area was organized as
        Minzhong Commandery. The area seems to have continued mostly independent
        of Chinese control for the next century. The Han dynasty followed the
        short-lived Qin, and Emperor Gaozu of Han declared both Minyue and
        neighboring Nanyue to be autonomous vassal kingdoms. In 202 BC, Emperor
        Gaozu enfeoffed a leader named Wuzhu,as King of Minyue, and a walled
        city called Ye was built. The founding of Ye in 202 BC has become the
        traditional founding date of the city of Fuzhou. In 110 BC, the armies
        of Emperor Wu of Han defeated the Minyue kingdom's armies during the
        Han–Minyue War and annexed its territory and people into China.[14] Many
        Minyue citizens were forcibly relocated into the Jianghuai area, and the
        Yue ethnic group was mostly assimilated into the Chinese, causing a
        sharp decline in Ye's inhabitants. The area was eventually re-organized
        as a county in 85 BC.
