          Fuzhou has grown considerably since the establishment of the People's
          Republic of China in 1949. Its water communications have been improved
          by the clearing of the Min River for navigation by medium-sized craft
          upstream to Nanping in central Fujian. In 1956 a railway linking Fuzhou
          with the interior of the province and with the main Chinese railway
          system was opened. The port too has been improved; Fuzhou itself is no
          longer accessible to seagoing ships, but Mawei (Luoxingta) port and
          another outer harbour, at Guantou on the coast of the East China Sea,
          have been modernized and improved. An express highway connects the city
          with Xiamen (Amoy), another major coastal city in Fujian. Fuzhou's
          international airport has regular flights to Hong Kong and other major
          cities in China.

          Two large power-generating facilities near Fuzhou—a thermal plant and
          the Shuikou hydroelectric station on the Min River—supply power to the
          city. The city is a centre for industrial chemicals and has
          food-processing, timber-working, engineering, electronics, papermaking,
          printing, and textile industries. In 1984 Fuzhou was designated one of
          China's “open” cities in the new open-door policy inviting foreign
          investments, and an economic and high-technology development zone in
          Mawei—together with other foreign investment districts—has been
          established.

          Handicrafts remain important, and the city is famous for its lacquer and
          wood products. Among Fuzhou's institutions of higher learning are Fujian
          Medical University (1937), Fuzhou University (1958), Fujian Normal
          University (1907), Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University (1936),
          and a research institute of the Chinese Academy of Science. Fuzhou is a
          city two millennia old, known for its history and culture, and in 1986
          the central government added it to the list of specially designated
          historical and cultural cities
